# Gate
* [Get Started](http://samolds.github.io/gate)
* [See 'app' on GAE](http://gate-example.appspot.com)


### System Requirements
* [Google App Engine SDK](http://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads)
* Python 2.7


### Setup Instructions
The following will set up the final checkpoint as an example for what can be
achieved with this tutorial. A version of the final checkpoint is already
deployed on Google App Engine [here](http://gate-example.appengine.com).

```
git clone http://github.com/samolds/gate.git
cd gate
/usr/local/google_appengine/dev_appserver.py app
```

You should now have a skeleton of the site up and running on localhost:8080.
