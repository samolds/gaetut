"The non-developers start to finish guide for developing a web app"


What is it?
  * Trying to be the most userfriendly (non wordpress, non tumblr) way to develop
    your own web app

Why am I doing this?
  * I've used my fair share of tutorials. I thought it was time to try and give
    back to the community.
  * Who is it for
      People like Brittany, Christy, even Brett
  * Also, I wanted to learn google app engine: best way to learn something is to
    try and teach someone else. In the process, I learned about static website
    hosting of GitHub pages, static page generation with Jinja, and making
    fancy youtube videos
