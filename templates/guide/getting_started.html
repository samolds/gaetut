<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<h4>Let's get rolling</h4>
<hr />
<p>
  The first thing you're going to need is a development environment, or a way to write
  and run your code. I prefer using the Terminal. It might have a bit of a learning curve,
  but that's why you're here - to learn!
</p>
<p>
  I use the Terminal to navigate through my computer system. You can achieve the exact same
  results as dragging and dropping folders, creating new files, and moving stuff to the
  trash all by typing a few simple commands. Later on, I'll cover using the Terminal to
  create and edit files using Vim. But first, let's go over the basic tools you'll need to
  know to use the Command Line.
</p>
<p>
  I'm going to assume that for this tutorial you will have the Terminal open and are
  following along as I describe some of the basic commands.
</p>

<br />
<h4>Command Line Navigation</h4>
<hr />
<h5>cd</h5>
  <p class="indent2">
    <code>cd</code> is used to change directories. Usually, you might double click on a
    folder to open it, but if you type <code>cd folder-name</code>, you will place yourself
    into that directory. You can also use <kbd>tab</kbd> to autocomplete 'folder-name'
    by simply pressing <kbd>tab</kbd> if you have typed the first few letters of the name.
    It's important to remember that <code>cd</code> is always in reference to the current
    active directory.
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
    There are a handful of symbols that have special meanings. <code>.</code> means the
    current directory. <code>..</code> means the parent directory. <code>~</code> means
    the home directory. And it is possible to string together a series of <code>cd</code>
    commands using <code>/</code> between directory names.
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
    For example, <code>cd example</code> will change the active directory to 'example',
    as long as there is a directory called example within your current directory. But
    <code>cd ~</code> will change the active directory to Home regardless of where you
    are. And by stringing together some commands like <code>cd ~/Desktop/example</code>
    you can change to the example directory within Desktop from anywhere.
  </p>
<h5>ls</h5>
  <p class="indent2">
    <code>ls</code> will simply list all of the items within the active directory.
  </p>
<h5>mkdir</h5>
  <p class="indent2">
    <code>mkdir</code> will create a new directory wherever you specify. The new directory
    will be named whatever you put after the command (and avoid naming it something with
    a space). So <code>mkdir example</code> will create a directory called example in the
    active directory, and <code>mkdir ~/Desktop/example</code> will create a new directory
    in Desktop (as long as Desktop already exists).
  </p>
<h5>mv</h5>
  <p class="indent2">
    <code>mv</code> can be used in two general ways. It can be used to move a file from
    one directory to another, and it can also be used to rename files. The first string
    given after <code>mv</code> will be the file or directory to rename or move, and the
    second string given will be the new name or the new location.
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
    So <code>mv old.txt new.txt</code> will rename old.txt to new.txt. <code>mv dir1
    dir2</code> will rename the directory dir1 to dir2. But if dir2 already existed,
    the previous command would place dir1 inside of dir2. <code>mv document.txt dir1</code>
    will move document.txt into the directory dir1.
  </p>
  <p class="indent2">
    And if you would like to move a directory full of other directories and files, change
    the command to be <code>mv -r dir1 dir2</code>, as long as dir2 already exists.
  </p>
<h5>cp</h5>
  <p class="indent2">
    <code>cp</code> is used in the exact same manner as <code>mv</code>, only it will copy
    a file from one location to another, and can rename the file in the process. So
    <code>cp hello.txt dir/goodbye.txt</code> will copy the file contents from hello.txt
    to inside of the dir directory and rename it to goodbye.txt. But if you want to just
    copy it to a new location without renaming it, you could use one of the special
    symbols mentioned before, such as <code>cp hello.txt dir/.</code> to just copy the
    file, including the name, into the dir directory.
  </p>
<h5>rm</h5>
  <p class="indent2">
    <code>rm</code> is used to delete files and directories. But be careful, because this
    will actually just delete files without an "are you sure" prompt or putting them into
    the trash to be cleared later. Use <code>rm hello.txt</code> to delete the hello.txt
    file. If you would like to remove a directory and all of its contents modify the
    command to be <code>rm -r dir</code>.
  </p>

<br />
<h4>Vim</h4>
<hr />
<p>
  Make sure to check out the Vim tutorial in the External Resources. But here's a quick
  (poorly done) explanation.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
Vim is a program used for creating and editing files within Terminal. Simply entering
<code>vim file.txt</code> into the Command Line will open a Vim session where you can
create or edit file.txt. Vim is known as an IDE, and if you'd like to use another one
like Emacs or Eclipse, that's fine - but I'm going to cover Vim because I think it's an
incredibly useful tool.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
Vim also has a bit of a learning curve and might seem a bit basic or lame at first, but
it is very powerful and customizable. The first thing you might notice is that nothing
you type will show up. There are a handful of different modes that you can enter while
editing a document. When you first enter Vim, you are in visual mode which provides a
handful of unique tools. If you would like to type anything, you must enter insert mode.
To do this, simply hit <kbd>i</kbd> on the keyboard. To end any active mode, hit
<kbd>esc</kbd>. The next thing you might notice is that you cannot use your cursor, you
have to navigate with the arrow keys. And if you would like to save your new or updated
file exit your active mode (<kbd>esc</kbd>) and type <code>:w</code> followed by
<kbd>enter</kbd>. To quit Vim, exit the active mode as above and type <code>:q</code>
followed by <kbd>enter</kbd>. The above commands can be combined to save and quit by
entering <code>:wq</code>. After saving and quiting Vim file.txt will be a new file,
or the existing file will have been updated.
</p>

<h4>Review</h4>
<hr />
<p>
  You should now have a good understand of what the following series of commands will
  accomplish.
</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">
cd ~/Desktop
ls
mkdir gatetest
ls
cd gatetest
vim test1.txt
vim test2.txt
ls
rm test1.txt
ls
cd ..
rm -r gatetest</code></pre>

<p>But to review each line:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Changes your active directory to 'Desktop'</li>
  <li>Lists the items within the 'Desktop' directory</li>
  <li>Makes a new directory in 'Desktop' called gatetest</li>
  <li>Lists the items within the 'Desktop' directory</li>
  <li>Changes your active directory to 'gatetest'</li>
  <li>Begins a Vim session for a file called test1.txt</li>
  <li>Begins a Vim session for a file called test2.txt</li>
  <li>Lists the items within the 'gatetest' directory</li>
  <li>Deletes the test1.txt file</li>
  <li>Lists the items within the 'gatetest' directory</li>
  <li>Changes the directory to gatetest's parent directory (Desktop)</li>
  <li>Deletes the gatetest directory and all of its content</li>
</ol>
