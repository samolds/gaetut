<h2>The Database</h2>
<h4>Storing user's data</h4>
<hr />

<p>
  Earlier, we touched on the Model (in the MVC Pattern) - the time has come to continue this topic. The
  model defines how the users data will be stored by your webapp. Think of it like defining the columns
  of a spreadsheet, a very rigid and inflexible spreadsheet. But once you define this spreadsheet, or
  <span class="vocab">database</span>, you can store all sorts of stuff in it. Instead of writing
  static HTML pages all the time, you could create an <span class="vocab">HTML form</span> that allows
  you to post new blog entries. The blog posts will be stored in the database and then retrieved
  whenever someone goes to read it.

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>
  By the end of this section, you should be able to understand the changes made in
  <a href="https://github.com/samolds/gate/tree/master/checkpoints/4-interactive">Checkpoint 4 - Interactive</a>.

<h3>Justification</h3>
<p>
  But I like writing static HTML pages, and creating a database and dealing with forms and user's posting
  data sounds hard! Why should I?
</p>
<p>
  Well, for a few reasons. Having a database and forms allows for people to be able to interact with your
  webpage. Sure, you could still write all of your blog posts with just static HTML, but if you want to
  allow users to add comments you'd need a database.
