<h2>Overview</h2>
<h4>What to expect</h4>
<hr />
<p>
  This tutorial is advertised as covering everything you need to get a
  website built from the ground up without any previous experience. So
  here's what I'm going to try and do and the assumptions I'm making:
</p>

<p>Goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Help you get a development environment set up on your machine</li>
  <li>Get you familiar with working in the shell (AKA the command line)</li>
  <li>Get you familiar with some basic code; specifically Python</li>
  <li>Get you familiar with HTML and CSS and how to create a webpage</li>
  <li>Explain some of the basic architecture and patterns behind most modern websites</li>
  <li>How to combine all of these ideas with the webapp2 framework into a full website</li>
  <li>Explain how to actually get your project pushed up to Google App Engine</li>
</ul>

<p>Assumptions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You have little to no coding experience</li>
  <li>You have briefly skimmed over the Vim, Python, and HTML tutorials (the External Resources to the left)</li>
  <li>You have no web development experience</li>
  <li>You have your own computer to develop things on</li>
  <li>You are using the OSX or Linux operating systems (this tutorial will still be useful
      for Windows users, but untested)</li>
</ul>
