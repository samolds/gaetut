<h2>Hello World</h2>
<h4>Just the barebones</h4>
<hr />

<p>
  Got all that? I didn't think so. If all you took away from that is "Mitochondria
  is the powerhouse of the cell", I think you'll still be okay. That's probably
  my fault, though. I just threw five pages of gobbly gook text at you without any
  actual examples. I've hoped you've been following along in the terminal, but I
  know that's optimistic. So far, everything I've been covering has just been the
  basics for the technologies and languages that I'll be using; things that you
  should probably be learning from other, more complete tutorials. And all of the
  example checkpoints that I wrote (available
  <a href="http://github.com/samolds/gate">on my GitHub</a>) haven't actually been
  useful... until now! Bum bum buuummm.
</p>
<p>
  To get the code in all of the Checkpoints
  <a href="https://github.com/samolds/gate/archive/master.zip">download a zip file</a>
  of the project, and then unzip it.
</p>

<br />
<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>
  We will now actually begin to put all of the pieces together. By the end of this 
  page you should be caught up to
  <a href="https://github.com/samolds/gate/tree/master/checkpoints/1-barebone">Checkpoint 1 - Barebone</a>.
</p>

<br />
<h3>Let the Games Begin</h3>
<p>
  Make sure that you have the Google App Engine SDK downloaded and installed. If you
  don't, go <a href="http://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads">here</a> to do it.
</p>
<p>
  Open Terminal and navigate to a directory where you'll want to keep all of your
  work. I will be working out of a directory called "gate" in "~/Desktop/projects".
  All we'll need to get started are two files: app.yaml, and barebone.py.
</p>

<h4>app.yaml</h4>
<div class="indent2">
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-clike">
version: 1
runtime: python27
api_version: 1
threadsafe: true

handlers:
- url: /.*
  script: barebone.app</code></pre>
</div>
<p class="indent2">
  This file is just some configuration settings that are required by Google App Engine
  to understand how it is supposed to handle your webapp. The important things to
  notice are line 2 and lines 6 - 8. Line 2 says that the app will be using version
  2.7 of Python. Lines 6 - 8 says that the barebone application will handle all web
  requests.
</p>

<h4>barebone.py</h4>
<div class="indent2">
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-python">
import webapp2

class MainPage(webapp2.RequestHandler):
  def get(self):
    self.response.write("Hello, World!")

class SecondPage(webapp2.RequestHandler):
  def get(self):
    self.response.write("New page!")

app = webapp2.WSGIApplication([
  ('/', MainPage),
  ('/two', SecondPage),
], debug=True)</code></pre>
</div>
<p class="indent2">
  This is where the interesting stuff happens. Let's start at the beginning.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
  There is a <code>webapp2</code> library that the Google App Engine SDK provides. When
  you import it, you become able to use things like the RequestHandler and the
  WSGIApplication. These things take care of a lot of little details you shouldn't worry
  about.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
  With this webapp2 library, each web page you create can be thought of as a Python
  class. Each class will have a function called <code>get</code> so that you can request
  the webpage. In this example, when the MainPage webpage is requested, "Hello, World!"
  will be returned and displayed on the page, and SecondPage will display "New page!".
  If you're paying close attention you'll notice that this isn't using any HTML, even
  though that's all we covered in the last section. But don't worry, we'll start using
  some HTML soon.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
  The last four lines of barebones.py are routing requests to the correct handlers. When
  a request is made for '/' (this represents the root of your application), it will be
  handled by the MainPage class. When someone requests 'whatever.com/two', the SecondPage
  class will handle that request.
</p>


<br />
<h3>Time to Test</h3>
<p>
  If you downloaded and installed the Google App Engine SDK correctly, and installed
  it to <code>/usr/local/</code>, you just have to execute one command to get your
  Hello World example running.
</p>
<p>
  <code>cd</code> out of your working directory, and start your dev server.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
cd ..
/usr/local/google_appengine/dev_appserver.py gate</code></pre>
<p>
  Now go to "<a href="localhost:8080">localhost:8080</a>" in your web browser and you will
  see "Hello, World!". It's not very impressive at this point, but it's a huge milestone.
  Pat yourself on the back and go eat some girl scout cookies to celebrate.
