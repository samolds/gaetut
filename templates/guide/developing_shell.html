<h2>Developing in the Shell</h2>
<h4>Getting down to business</h4>
<hr />
<p>
  By now, you should be familiar with how to use Terminal to navigate through
  directories and create and edit files with Vim, even if it's just barely.
  But lets start playing around with some actual code to see why the hassle
  of learning the Command Line is actually worth while.
</p>
<p>
  This tutorial requires any version of Python 2.7. Type <code>python -V</code>
  to check your version of Python.
</p>
<p>
  Let's start by writing our first Python program! It will be very simple, but
  hopefully it will be enough to whet your appetite so that you can go above
  and beyond this tutorial. We'll begin by opening Terminal and navigating to
  a directory where you will store all of your work. Then, let's create a new
  Python file using Vim.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
cd ~
mkdir gate-tutorial
vim example.py
</pre></code>

<p>
  Inside of your Vim session, type the following block of code and see if you
  can figure out what it's going to do before you execute it. I recommend
  typing it all in to help you remember, but if you'd like to copy and paste
  into Vim enter Insert mode (hit <kbd>i</kbd>) and paste like you normally
  would. Don't worry if you don't understand what this code is doing, we're
  going to cover some Python basics next!
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
def repeat(times):
  for i in range(times):
    print "Hello"

repeat(4)
</code></pre>

<p>
  To execute your new Python script save and quit Vim (<code>:wq</code>), and
  then do the following:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
python example.py
</pre></code>

<p>
  Any Python script you write can be executed at the Command Line by typing
  <code>python &lt;file_name.py&gt;</code>. Click
  <a href="#output1" onclick="toggleCollapse('output1')">here</a> to verify your
  output.
</p>

<div id="output1" class="collapse out">
<pre><code>Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello</code></pre>
</div>
