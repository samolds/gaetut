<p>
  Yes, I know this video is long, abruptly ends, and I obviously can't contain my
  excitement, but it might help you to get familiar with the process of writing code
  and learning some of the more complex concepts. (Also, I don't think the 'related'
  videos are related at all.)
</p>
<p>
  This video skims over the Overview, Getting Started, Developing in the Shell,
  and Python Basics sections very briefly. Let's jump back into it all in a bit
  more depth.
