<h2>Python</h2>
<h4>A reference</h4>
<hr />

<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>strings, ints, doubles, and booleans</p>
<p class="indent1">
  String variables are used
  to store any series of characters. Strings can represent a letter, a word, a sentence,
  a paragraph, numbers, equations, etc. Integers are used to represent whole numbers,
  and can be very useful for mathematic situations. Doubles are used to represent
  numbers with decimal points. Booleans are used to represent true and false and are
  used in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra">boolean logic</a>.
</p>

<br />
<h3>Data Structures</h3>
<p>lists, and dicts</p>
<p class="indent1">
  Lists are essentially just a series of variables. Lists, in Python, are similar to arrays
  in other languages. If you're not familiar with an array, they store a series of variables
  together. If you want to access a single element in the list you reference its index.
  Lists are 0-indexed, meaning that the first element has an index of 0, the second has an
  index of 1, and so on.
</p>
<p class="indent1">
  Dicts are similar to lists except each entry has a key and a value, similar to a dictionary.
  Dicts are similar to maps in other languages. If you want to access a single value, you
  have to use the provided key. All keys have to be unique within a single dict. The key can
  be thought of as a custom index in the list example. Lets do another interactive example.
</p>

<h3>Control Flow Tools</h3>
<p><code>if elif else</code> statements</p>
<p class="indent1">
  The <code>if</code> block is your program's mitochondria (mitochondria is the powerhouse of the
  cell!). It allows for multiple paths to be taken through your code. The code inside of the first
  <code>if</code> will be executed if the boolean check immediately after the <code>if</code> is
  true. If it is false, then it will check the next <code>elif</code> boolean check to see if it
  is true. If nothing evaluates to true, the <code>else</code> block will execute. The only
  required piece is the <code>if</code> block. The following are all correct.
</p>

<br />
<p><code>for</code> loops</p>
<p class="indent1">
  The <code>for</code> loop is also a crucial part of controlling the flow of your program. If you
  want to repeat the same block of code multiple times, or iterate through every element in a list,
  then the <code>for</code> loop is for you!
</p>
<p class="indent1">
  The <code>range()</code> function is a <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html">built-in</a>
  function in python. It will create a list out of the integer parameter (we'll cover functions and
  parameters soon). If you call <code>range(4)</code> a list will be created of integers from 0 to 3.
  This is very useful with <code>for</code> loops in Python. There is an example below that makes use
  of the <code>range()</code> function, a <code>for</code> loop, and an <code>if/else</code> block.
</p>

<br />
<p><code>while</code> loops</p>
<p class="indent1">
  <code>while</code> loops are very similar to for loops. They allow you to repeat certain sections of
  your code for the duration that some check is true. While loops perform a boolean check before every
  iteration to make sure it should repeat, or break. The boolean check comes immediately after the
  <code>while</code> keyword. Below is a simple example:
</p>

<br />
<p><code>def</code> functions</p>
<p class="indent1">
  Sometimes you might want to use the same block of code in multiple places and you'll be tempted
  to copy and paste. Never ever copy and paste. If there is a piece of code that you would like to
  reuse, turn it into a function! A function is your own custom set of commands that you can call
  with a single command instead of copying and pasting multiple lines of code. Don't worry if your
  output doesn't exactly match on this one; 5 random colors should be printed out.
</p>

<br />
<p>function arguments</p>
<p class="indent1">
  Functions become much more powerful if they can accept variables that you can then manipulate. If
  we modify the previous function we wrote, we can have it accept incoming arguments, or parameters.
  But we'll modify it so that the functionality stays the same. Again, don't worry about the output
  being exactly the same.
</p>

<br />
<h3>Custom Structures AKA Objects</h3>
<p>classes</p>
<p class="indent1">
  If you would like to create your own object, like a string or int, you have to build it out of
  the existing primary types. You could create and object called Person, and it could contain a
  name, a birthday, and an ethnicity. And you could give it custom functions like
  <code>get_age()</code>. Here's an example of what a Person class might look like.
</p>

<div class="indent1">
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-python">
from datetime import datetime

class Person():
  def __init__(self, name, birth_year, ethnicity=None):
    self.name = name
    self.birth_year = birth_year
    self.ethnicity = ethnicity
    
  def get_age(self):
    age = datetime.now().year - self.birth_year
    return age
    
john = Person("John", 1990)</code></pre>
</div>

<br />
<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>visibility</p>
<p class="indent1">
  The scope is always something you have to keep in mind. All variables, functions, and data
  structures maintain some kind of scope. The scope refers to what is visible in certain parts
  of your code. If you declare a <span class="vocab">global variable</span> at the top of your
  code, all of your functions will be able to see it. But if you declare a variable in one
  function, only that function can see the variable. Here's a quick demo.
</p>

<div class="indent1">
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-python">
x = "Hello, World!" # global variable

def local_one():
  y = "Hello locals."
  print x # global variables are visible here

def local_two():
  z = "Howdy folks."
  print z # printed from the same scope z was declared

print x
print y # error! local_one() scope has ended, along with y</code></pre>
</div>
